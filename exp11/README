9 Servers and 2 candidate servers per each client agent.
Video Length: 720
Topology: Hierarchical512
Scenarios: 0 ~ 3
Sce0 : bb_link_bw = 500 Mbps
Sce1 : bb_link_bw = 250 Mbps
Sce2 : bb_link_bw = 100 Mbps
Sce3 : bb_link_bw = 50 Mbps

Expectation: Cooperation enabled selection splits traffic between local and upper network much better than non-cooperative one.
Possible Guess: they are similar due to the randomness of switching.

Most unexpected case: though capacity to two links are the same in Sce3, because all 64 users are still competing capacity, users staying
in the network wants to switch out if a little QoE drops and the same for users want to switch in.

Further Solutions: compare QoE, if not above 0.5 difference, stay with the current one.
